# Quantitative-Methods-Learning-Materials  
This repository contains learning materials that I created as the teaching assistant for a masters level quantitative methods course. The labs cover things like basic R skills, linear/polynomial regression, model selection methods, treatment of outliers, and ANOVA. Some of the labs were created in collaboration with my classmates Jenny Liu, Devin Khosla, and Andrea Hassler.
